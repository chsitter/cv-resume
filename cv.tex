\section{Personal Statement}
I'm a highly qualified and enthusiastic software architect with a passion for creating innovative large-scale financial systems that better the lives of thousands.
It is my firm belief that through questioning the status quo and looking at problems through the eyes of a customer, be that a developer or an end user, better products can be created that push technological as well as functional limits.
I strive to further my skills, knowledge and education, while working in a forward thinking, fast-paced environment where I can directly influence the roadmap of products and departments, both functional and technological.

I am currently looking for a new challenge where I can steer technological transformation towards modern best practices, embrace BaaS (Banking as a Service) which I am very passionate about, and establish a fail-fast/fail-forward culture with a focus on observability and quality.

\section{Employment}
\workplace{Solutions Architect}{SCB Securities via Caplin Systems Ltd.}{May 2018 - Current}
Looking for a new challenge, I signed up to be the Solutions Architect as well as Technical Lead for a client facing project with third largest Thai bank. Building a cross asset retail investment app, called EasyInvest, that integrates with roughly 20 legacy systems and handles tens of thousands of users every day, my main responsibilities are to establish technologial best practices, architect the system, supervise development teams as well as implement spikes and production features. In addition to the technical responsibilities I am involved in managing the client relationship and liaise between stakeholders on both sides. Being actively involved in a project of this magnitude has taught me a lot about maintaining a good vendor/client relationships as well as supervising and coordinating a team of 30 engineers to work efficiently.

\workplace{Platform Architect}{Caplin Systems Ltd.}{Dec 2015 - May 2018}
After working on the platform team for a bit over a year I took over as the architect and my main responsibilities were to maintain the platform software stack ($\sim$ 70 products written in C, Java, C\#, Objective-C, JS and Python) for existing customers as well as enhance them based on regulatory changes, technological movement as well as new customer requirements. This led me to conceptualise an entirely new system which is designed to better suit current cloud-hosting requirements while allowing a smooth transition for existing customers.

\workplace{Technical Team Lead}{Caplin Systems Ltd.}{Nov 2014 - Dec 2015}
After joining the companies platform team I took over the technical team lead role. The role included managing the team and sprints, providing technical guidance in C, Java, JNI and Lua to team members as well as implementing new features and finding/fixing bugs in a large legacy codebase. In addition to the daily duties, I worked with the architect on the design of new features and got involved in gathering requirements from customers, on-site as well as over webex conferences.

\workplace{Software Engineer}{Caplin Systems Ltd.}{Feb 2013 - Nov 2014}
I worked with a Scrum team on delivering a securities trading platform to a major Swiss bank. My role was to implement the backend Java components to enable fast instrument search using in-memory databases, real-time price streaming and trading as well as the design and implementation of a watchlist component that exposed an easy to use messaging API for front-end team to integrate integrate with.
