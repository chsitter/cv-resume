\section{Employmet}
\workplace{Platform Architect}{Caplin Systems Ltd.}{Dec 2015 - Current}
After working on the platform team for a bit over a year I took over as the architect and my main responsibilities were to maintain the platform software stack ($\sim$ 70 products written in C, Java, C\#, Objective-C, JS and Python) for existing customers as well as enhance them based on regulatory changes, technological movement as well as new customer requirements. This lead me to conceptualise an entirely new system which is designed to better suit current cloud-hosting requirements while allowing a smooth transition for existing customers.

\workplace{Technical Team Lead}{Caplin Systems Ltd.}{Nov 2014 - Dec 2015}
After joining the companies platform team I took over the technical team lead role. The role included managing the team and sprints, providing technical guidance in C, Java, JNI and Lua to team members as well as implementing new features and finding/fixing bugs in a large legacy codebase. In addition to the daily duties, I worked with the architect on the design of new features and got involved in gathering requirements from customers, on-site as well as over webex conferences.

\workplace{Software Engineer}{Caplin Systems Ltd.}{Feb 2013 - Nov 2014}
I worked with a Scrum team on delivering a securities trading platform to a major Swiss bank. My role was to implement the backend Java components to enable fast instrument search using in-memory databases, real-time price streaming and trading as well as the design and implementation of a watchlist component that exposed an easy to use messaging API for front-end team to integrate integrate with.

\workplace{Systems Engineer}{Infineon Technologies Austria}{Mar 2010 - Aug 2012}
My main responsibility was to build and maintain the asterisk VoIP infrastructure of the company. This included the operation and maintenance of the asterisk servers, development of a dial-plan that was used for global call routing as well as the development and operation of an in-house VoIP conferencing module for asterisk written in C. The call routing as well as the conferencing solution ended up being used extensively and saved the company hundreds of thousand Euro a year.

In the final year of my undergraduate studies, I worked on a joint research project with the company and university that set out to evaluate complex event processing as a replacement technology for the monitoring as well as conrol of the automated manufacturing lines. While the project was a success, the cost of implementing it would have been too large and it never came to fruition.
